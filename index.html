    	This is Marcel's contribution to the page. I enjoy playing various video games and drinking whiskey.
    	My favorite games are the <span style="color: red">DOOM</span> games which are made by 
    	<a href="https://www.idsoftware.com/en-us">id software</a>. Working there is also a career goal of mine.

        There are over 1,400 species of bats worldwide. Bats are the only flying mammal, and some species, 
	such as the <span style="color:#89e851">Brazilian Free-Tailed bat</span>, can fly over 100 mph.
	One of the largest bats in the world is the <span style="color: #e8c123">Giant Golden-Crowned Flying Fox.</span>
	<p>Bats are also really cool. - Marcel</p>
